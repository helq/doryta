# endian.h

This provides the endian conversion functions form endian.h on Windows, Linux,
*BSD, and Mac OS X. You still need to use `-std=gnu99` instead of `-std=c99`
for gcc. The functions might actually be macros. Functions: htobe16, htole16,
be16toh, le16toh, htobe32, htole32, be32toh, le32toh, htobe64, htole64,
be64toh, le64toh.

The implementation was written by Mathias Panzenb√∂ck and published in this
[Gist][gist].

## Install
